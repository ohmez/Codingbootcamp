Day 6 Notes

Bootstrap - contains reset within - probably best to get very familiar with
starting sites like this and then adding custom CSS ontop of bootstrap.

Wireframing - figma.com - 

free source to help design prototype sites

when using columns in bootstrap

take 12 divided by the total columns you want to get the col-lg-< #>

so if I want 3 columns I take 12 / 3 = 3 goes into 12 4 times meaning 4.
