### Class notes 12.1.18 Saturday
We've been talking about sequelize.
We've used two methods mainly so far;
-findAll,  which selects all from the database in a  table with conditions. 
-findOne, which selects data from a table with specific conditions. or first       record with conditions. 
-destroy, deletes records from the database. 
-update - Updates all records matching conditions. 

db.modelName.findAll({values},{options}) - if left blank find all will find all values. options is where we put conditions like `where: {id: 1}`

When doing validations you apply them to the models, this will make it to where data is validated on the server side before its put into the database. 

Deprecated warnings - these are saying that the function name or value you're using from the npm is being updated, their may be a new way to do it but if your npm like sequelize is dependent on an older version of another npm this is the type of error you'll see; deprecated doesn't mean it's going to go away but it could I think.

A regular expressions, theyr'e the search paramaters that look at values of input.

///

it can have groups / < means start of a line>
/^(a-zA-z)*(0-9)

We demo a blog where you post a title, body, and a catigory. the backend generates a timestamp of DATETIME on its own.
Posts can be deleted or edited from the homescreen viewing all posts. 

Side conversation on `env` the environment where values live and are called to using `process.env` we've used this before where you're using node to run the servers etc.
heroku and other admins or hosts will have defined ports and stuff so you'd use 
```js
var port = process.env.PORT || 3030;
```

### Models
In creating a model you have to use a defined structure:
I prefer the freezeTableName so it doesn't pluralize:
```js
module.exports = (sequelize, DataTypes) => {
return sequelize.define('post', {columns:{type:DataTypes.STRING}},{freezeTableName:true});
};
```
There are many DataTypes options [here](http://docs.sequelizejs.com/manual/tutorial/models-definition.html#data-types)
We kind of touch on the way that models are built which includes a lot of the issues I've run into with sequelize where it has a lot of auto initiated things like timestamps and plural table names. We didn't cover this as much when we were introduced but it's caused a couple things not to work.
The documentation has a bit more on model defenitions explaining whats done, but it's not the greatest either, you have to dig for it all.
