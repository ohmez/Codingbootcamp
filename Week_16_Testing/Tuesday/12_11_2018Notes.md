### 12/11/2018 Tuesday Class Notes
We go over an activity on mocha and chai; we're doing testing.
These are two NPM's that help developers test their code.
It runs functions and escapes errors if they pop so that way you can run all the code and verify where if any or all errors are.


#### API Testing
We're getting an example.text.js file which will test GET and POST functions on a database.
This is set up to work on the example app we were given for the project two test.
with some slight altering this will work for our own API routes.
