### 12/11/2018 Tuesday Class Notes
We go over an activity on mocha and chai; we're doing testing.
These are two NPM's that help developers test their code.
It runs functions and escapes errors if they pop so that way you can run all the code and verify where if any or all errors are.

`npm install -D mocha chai`

#### Tax Test
We write a file to test the tax.js file we write where it adds tax to an integer.
```js
var calculateTax = function(price) {
  // Fill in code here
  var tax = 1.08;
  return price * tax;
};
```
Once the calctax is written we can write our test file 
```js
describe('calculateTax', () => {
    it('should calc tax', () => {
        var result = calculateTax(4);
        expect(result).to.equal(4.32)
    });
    it('Should calc tax on decimal', () => {
        var result = calculateTax(4.50);
        expect(result).to.equal(4.86);
    });
    it('should give error on string', () => {
        var result = calculateTax('bananan');
        expect(result).to.be.Throw;
    });
});
```
The example wrote a different way to catch the error test
```js
it('should throw error if not number', () => {
    var call = () =>{ calculateTax('potato')};
    expect(call).to.throw(Error, 'parameter price is required');
});
```
This showed me some more things that were needed with the tax.js file and the tax.test.js
```js
describe('calculateTax', () => {
    it('should calc tax', () => {
        var result = calculateTax(4);
        expect(result).to.equal(4.32)
    });
    it('Should calc tax on decimal', () => {
        var result = calculateTax(4.50);
        expect(result).to.equal(4.86);
    });
    it('should throw error if not number', () => {
        var call = () => { calculateTax('potato')};
        expect(call).to.throw(Error);
    });
});
// and tax had to be changed. 
var calculateTax = function(price) {
  var tax = 1.08;
  // Fill in code here
  if(typeof price !== "number" ) {
   throw new Error('price must be number');
  } else return price * tax;
};
```
`npm run test` is called in node and if your root has a /test/ folder then you have the /test/tax.test.js 
I swear this only works using these older versions of mocha and chai and that the newer versions have seriously changed
```json
"scripts": {
    "test": "mocha"
  },
"directories": {
    "test": "test"
  },
"devDependencies": {
    "chai": "^3.5.0",
    "mocha": "^3.0.0"
  }
```


#### API Testing
We're getting an example.text.js file which will test GET and POST functions on a database.
This is set up to work on the example app we were given for the project two test.
with some slight altering this will work for our own API routes. 

`npm install -D chai-http` is needed for api testing. 

```js
beforeEach(function() {
    request = chai.request(server);
    return db.sequelize.sync({force:true});
});
```
this is key to testing database calls and creations without overloading it all with the test data etc.
recreates the database for every test individually. 

In order to get any of the testing to work I had to:
`npm install -D cross-env`
update package.json - mainly the test and devDependencies 
```json
"scripts": {
    "start": "node server.js",
    "lint": "eslint **/*.js --quiet",
    "fix": "eslint --fix .",
    "test": "cross-env NODE_ENV=test mocha -u tdd --reporter spec --exit"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "chai": "^4.1.2",
    "chai-http": "^4.0.0",
    "cross-env": "^5.2.0",
    "eslint": "^4.19.1",
    "eslint-config-prettier": "^2.9.0",
    "eslint-plugin-prettier": "^2.6.2",
    "mocha": "^5.2.0",
    "prettier": "^1.13.7"
  }
```
Mark wrote out our tests for our project, but I was able to run the test file and get it to work, reviewing the test file also made sense.
