# 1/22/2019 Class Notes React app from scratch with mongodb and API calls
to establish a new app with mongo db you must establish the database first.
we're building on top of what we started on Saturday [here](./../01_Saturday/01_activity/server.js)

* `for the server.js`
```js
const mongoose = require("mongoose");
const db = require("./models")
mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost/crm',() => {
  console.log('connected to db:crm');
});
```
* `for the models/filename`
```js
const Mongoose = require('mongoose'):
const Schema = Mongoose.Schema;

const CustomerSchema = new Schema({
    firstName: {
        type: String,
        required: true
    },
    lastName: {
        type: String,
        required: true
    },
    email: {
        type: String,
        required: true
    }
});
const Customer = Mongoose.model("Customer", CustomerSchema);
module.exports = Customer;
```
Inside the models folder you have to create the index file that will manage the routes of `db = require('./models');`
```js
const Customer = require("./Customer.js");
module.exports = {
    Customer: Customer
};
```
Then you need `robo 3T`, right click `connection` on top left `create new databse`
set it as you named it in the `server.js` in this case its `crm`.
add a test item once db is made and your schema is made
`db.customers.insert({firstName:"keagan", lastName:"cheatwood", email: "email@something.com"})`

Something is going wrong with my app, I can connect to the DB but when I go to the route I don't get anything.

`axios` allows you to request APIs or scrape sites, headless browser its called.
