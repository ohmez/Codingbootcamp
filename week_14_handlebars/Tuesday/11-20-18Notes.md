### Notes
We're creating another REST app thats going to be sending JSON data as an API.
we'll need to establish routes /api/quotes, /quotes. etc etc...
first we review the POST where we'll need to make a `connection.query(sql_code, (err,data) =>{console.log(data)});`
to know what you're sending to the database you have to use `req.body.author & req.body.quote` when doing a PUT or POST you use `req.body` when you do a GET you use `req.params` in most cases.
