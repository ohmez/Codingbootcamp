### Notes Saturday Class
We start by a quick assignment to build out a calculator api
```js
app.get('/:operator/:first/:second', (req,res) => {
    var operator = req.params.operator;
    var first = parseInt(req.params.first);
    var second = parseInt(req.params.second);
    switch(operator) {
        case 'add':
        result = first+second;
        break;
        case 'subtract':
        result = first-second;
        break;
        case 'multiply':
        result = first*second;
        break;
        case 'divide':
        result = first/second;
        break;
        default:
        result = 'sorry';
    }
    res.send(result);
});
```
In the review we go into package-json `npm start`

```js
scripts: {
    start: 'node expressCalculator.js';
}
```
if you do npm start while in the root folder of the package-json it will automatically open the file.
just like if you wrote it out; this is pretty cool, great to know. 
`npm test` works the same also which is pretty cool, its always there but i've never used it or known how to use it. 

#### Wizarding school
this is a database/express combination app.
first you'll have to establish the database
```sql
DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS wizzardry_db;
CREATE DATABASE wizzardry_db;
USE wizzardry_db;
CREATE TABLE schools (
    ID int AUTO_INCREMENT,
    name varchar(30) NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY 
    (id)
);
INSERT INTO schools
(name)
VALUES
('Hogwarts Whiches and Wizzards');
INSERT INTO schools
(name)
VALUES
('durmstrang Institute');
SELECT * FROM schools;
```

Side note on UID's which are unique keys that are auto generated; seems most databases include a way to generate them.
also many sites on them.
We actually need two modules `require('mysql') require('express');`
The HTML only populates all the data from the database.
first you initate the `app.get()` then immediately initiate the `connection.query(sql, (err,results) =>{ var html = 'buncha html'; res.send(html);})`.
This seems pretty straight forward.

#### Seinfeld 
We're creating a database for the seinfeld actors.
```js
var express = require('express');
var mysql = require('mysql');
var PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;
var app = express();
var connection = mysql.createConnection({
    host:"localhost",
    port: 3306,
    user: 'root',
    password: 'Wh0v1@n',
    database: 'seinfeld_db'
});
app.listen(PORT,(err) => {
    if(err) throw err;
    console.log('listening on ' +PORT);
});
connection.connect((err)=>{
    if (err) throw err;
    console.log('connected on to database');
});

```
It's key to establish both the connection to the database and the server before doing anything.
Mainly seinfeld is about the query
```js
var sqlQ = 'SELECT * FROM actors'
var sqlQ = 'SELECT * FROM actors ORDER BY coolness_points DESC'
var sqlQ = 'SELECT * FROM actors WHERE attitude = ?', [req.params.att];
```
Some things to note, `ORDER BY` sorts automatically low to high so `DESC` will reverse the order when displaying them. 

when writing code withing a string `'<h1 class = \'heading1\'> this text </h1>'`
adding \' will allow you to have a ' within ' x '. 
Didn't know that, have always stacked " these thing's " this way. 

### Discussion
Talking about toast and handlebars `{#if}`.
```js
var template = "<h1>{header}</h1>";
template.replace('{header}', 'this text');
```
handlebars is a templating language that allows you to do things like this.
templates are structures where the main content is a variable for you to fill in.
like madlibs.

### Handlebars activity
[handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/)
express has a handlebars npm option exphbs
`var require('express-handlebars')`
`app.engine('handlebars', exphbs({defaultLayout:'main'}));`
`app.engine('pug', require('pug'). __express);`
{{2}} will escape rendering so contents inside it won't get coded.
{{{3}}} will render it again.
handlebars requires folder structure `view>layouts>main.handlebars`.
but the file doesn't have to be main; you request the file when doing
`res.render('main',array);`
