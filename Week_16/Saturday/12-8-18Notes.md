### 12/8/2018 Saturday Class Notes
Currently working on group project but we're doing some activities on testing.

#### Error Handling
Try-catch is a testing method that you can do in javascript. 
```js
var filename = process.argv[2];
var readFile = require("./helpers").readFile;
try{
    readFile(filename);
}
catch (err) {
    console.log('error reading'+filename +'error logged and continuing');
};
console.log('the rest worked');
```
instead of javascript getting stuck and ending because of an error it continues on and reads the rest of the program. 


#### Dependencies
dev dependencies are like mocha and things used to test or work while developing
but depenencies are what're needed to use the application like express, sequelize, handlebars.
`npm install -D mocha` is installing as a devdependency and not a app dependency. 


#### Mocha
mocha is an npm that devs use to test their functions and can be ran from the command line.
`npm run test` will execute the test folder and shows all your tests if passing or not.





The rest of class is working on our projects
