java script is ecma script

java is not java script

everything is 1 of 3 types
String - words "" ''
number - number only
boolean - true or false only


if using if/else you need a boolean to initate the true/false, since if/else
is opperating as if this is true then A if else B else C else ETC....

capitolizations and semi-colons are important in javascripts

when using booleans you can do
 if = (true or false ) -- this is checking the assignments 
if == - this is checking that they match
if === - this is checking for exact match, variable type and variable value

----- so === will say that '21' and 21 are not equal because '21' is a string
------ while == will say that '21' and 21 are equal because they both are 21 just
one is a string and one is a number.
