Java Script
Variables are the nouns of coding - things,
Variables contain a name and a value

Console.log prints to the console - which is hidden 
Alert - creates a pop up
Prompt - creats an input field - has a default which means there must be 	other options.
Document.write - writes the data into the body wherever it is within the script, placement on the page is random and risky. possibly could be used for inputting into specific fields maybe?

Var fruit = ["apple", "banana", "kiwi"]
var even = [ 2,4,6,8,10]
Each item inside the array is marked as an index, indexes' are always 1 less than the total because they start at 0. 
so var even length is 5 but its index is 0-4.

call to indiex by fruit[0-2]; or even[0-4]


Creating for loops - 
// Looping through each item in the array and logging a message to the console.
      for (var i = 0; i < vegetables.length; i++) {
        console.log("I love " + vegetables[i]);
      }


for ( declaration; condition; incrementer)
condition means it will run as long as condition is true
incrementer tells it what to do at the end of the loop. 

you can place if inside of the for { } 

events are anytime something is done, moving the mouse or clicking, hitting keys, etc, are all events, eventlisteners are to catch actions being done.
