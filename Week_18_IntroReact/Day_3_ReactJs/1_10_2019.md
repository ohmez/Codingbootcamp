### Babel
Babel converts javascript types into other types, like EMS6 EMS5, 'ecma6'
babel.io or something site you can run conversions.
# Usage

check out npm `reactstrap`

Currently we're only using one `create-reactapp appname`
and replacing the src file, im saving the src files elswhere now to not overwrite them. 

#### React 
React is built up of components.
JSX is the HTML-like markup language 
    -It preprocesses (preprocessor) our code into javascript that creates HTML elements. 
    -Self closing tags must be closed <img> has to be <img/>
    -Embeded javascript can be used inside { }
    -
```js
const reactIs = "awesome";
const hello = () => <h1> react is so {reactIs}</hi>;
ReactDom.render(<hello />, )
```

Back tick allows you to call back 

```js
let test = 'hello ${props.name}';
```


Props are arguments that we can pass to the elements we're creating.
props are considered to be impunable ( unable to be changed )
react uses the object its passed, it doesn't alter the object,
the functions are built to pass data down as is. 
libary and method for react are `reactDOM` and `render()`
which is the virtual dom and rendering it to the page. 
javascript map can loop through react arrays you pass as props to generate handlebars for each loops ultimately.

```js
this.setState({key: newvalue})
```
