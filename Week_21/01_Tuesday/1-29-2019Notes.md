Selection sort and insertion sort are better on smaller arrays. 

Selection sort and insertion sort loop through each item in the array as many times as there are items in the array.

if n = array length then big O is N(2) N-Squared.

Insertion sort could be slightly faster than selection sort because of the way it compares back down the array not only up. 


Quick sort breaks the array in two from a random `piviot` this is a declared index that is generally selected at random, not necesarily the middle.
these two new arrays are then sorted by identifying a `pivot` again but then comparing using a insertion sort type method.

quick sort is faster because it holds less memory, the arrays being smaller than the original and recursion making them repeat to smaller arrays
makes the sort comparisons quicker, less to sort in a smaller array. 


```
psuedo code quick sort

1. generate random number with limit of array lenght for our PIVOT
    - Math.ciel(Math.random() * array.length) or something like that.
2. define 2 arrays LOW/LEFT & HIGH/RIGHT 
3. compare all items before PIVOT to PIVOT if greater move RIGHT if lower move LEFT.
    3a. Repeat comparison to all items RIGHT of PIVOT

```
