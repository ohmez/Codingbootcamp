## Math 
big o - number of computations
n - number of items
n(squared) - loop of all items X2, continues to n(cubed) etc.
if n=8
O(n)  = 8
O(log n) = 3
O(n^2) = 64

Data structures are like arrays, key value pairs (objects).
Structuring data is pivitol when you consider the possiblilty of scalling.
An array may be good, untill scalling goes so deep of arrays inside arrays inside arrays, you have to iterate through so many to identify, key value pairs then win out in structure.

data structure - way to organize data.
FIFO & LIFO - first in first out, last in last out. 
Stack - like a stack of plates, can only access top aka last thing.
queue - like a line of people, can only access bottom aka first person in the line.
linked list - knows who's in front and who's behind, like generations. it's connecting memory of different locations. 
array - doesn't have the reference to the items infront or behind it, its one set of memory.
objects are like hashes - associative arrays, values of references point to values of items in memory. 

javascript map is closest to linked list and assosiative arrays .
dictionaries - new Map();
