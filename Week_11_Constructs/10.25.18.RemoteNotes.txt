10/25/18 Notes - Node
npm is a command of node - node package manager 
npm init will prompt creating your own new package-json file.
entering through will make generic info, then Y for yes, then npm install
npm install (method) I.E. request, require, or any other methods u want.

Moving to 2/16/2019 - no problems on my part with this. (might be a zoom one instead?)

We start with command sort and review process.argv.
npm install grabs libraries at a specific moment in time.
package-lock.json will hold their library; if they make changes and you keep your lock file safe it'll work. if you npm install again it'll overwrite it seems. 
npm has tons of CDN type packages already built to communicate with API's
I wonder if it has one for the riot games one I want to use...
okay it does but its super different, these varry so much. thats intimidating. 
Finishing up the geocode helps me feel much better about how to use npm's
atleast in this format.
They have limitations to what they can do depending on who made them and for what purpose. these more highend/ common ones are built pretty cool.
This is where object orriented coding comes into play bigtime.
I'm loving the structure of things like options and seeing what other npms have.
