npm install -g 
this is a global install for all of your folders
npm install -g require would be a good one to do i'd think
npm install -g inspect-process
allows you to cmd: inspect filename instead of node filename, this will open the inspect tool and you can debugg your code, thats rad. I was having issues with homework. But i've figured out my issues since then.
We reviewed objects and creating their keys. I feel very comfortable with this. I try to build a lot of stuff using objects and keys but it doesn't always work, still figuring out using them as callbacks.
We're doing an example of this sort kind of where we're creating new objects using the stored command of javascript 'new'.
I spiced up my portfolio using constructs.
Constructs are like coodkie cutters, they construct objects by a function 
they may or may not be required to start with a capitol letter.
function Construct(){ this.that = that}; using this. to create multiple and with different values. 
module.exports = Animal; use require('./rainingc&d's') to call the functions from another javasheet.
Instansiation - creating instances is calling with 'new'.
java is loose script instead of var bob it'd be string bob; var has strong conditions in it already.
return this.hp >0; this will return a true or false  boolean if it is true or false; dynamic state boolean.
the rpg task was pretty easy making constructs for characters, it was kind of tricky initially to get the setting keys as functions.
but after repeating it a couple times its really coming together for this tamagotchi activity. 
I'm excited for the next step of tamagotchi's user input with these constructs is really cool.
