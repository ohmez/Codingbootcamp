Thursday 9/27/18 Class Notes
Officially in week 7; 25% of the way done. 1/4th
Starting with activity of creating a dynamic todolist.
We create and populate HTML with jquery created elements.
I was able to finish this project in time for the review of it.
I feel very comfortable with this.
Oh there was a good point Niko said its only usefull if we don't refresh
the page. I wonder if there's a way to maintain data thats populated by the user..
Today we're talking about ways to make things persist longer, YAY.
I love it when the next logical question is what we study.
This is called persistance. 
Session storage will keep the data even if refreshed
	- but once tab is closed data is gone.
Cookies can help access a server.
local storage can be updated;used offline.
once reconnected it can be updated to cookies or server.
in console
localStorage - returns object, with data content
sessionStorage - returns object, with data content
in console- application
you can see where files are stored and file pathing?
thats kinda creepy... hmmm (hackhelper??)
in console -
localStorage.setItem('foo', 'bar');
now obj shows foo as they 'key' with value of bar.
localStorage.whatever = 'hello';
this is like creating keys/properties of objects, you can make them or call to them with the . indicator. 
cookies stay if u close browser.. local storage doesnt..
Sessionstorage lives inside the window; this is probably where javascript memory objects are actually stored.
localstorage is not secure and is stored as a string.
cookies operate similar to localstorage but have a different syntax
document.cookie = "somename"="somevalue";
Working on the todolist with local storage was rough but the solution made sense; I think it was hardest because I didn't want to rewrite my whole initial solution.
Overall I don't see many concerns with the material covered today and I feel very confident in my ability and understanding from class.
